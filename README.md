# Projet4_OC_LaPanthere
 
 SEO project from OpenClassrooms.
 
 Resumption of an existing project and consequent optimization of accessibility, SEO and performance in general.
 
 The project is based on good practices and google recommendations in terms of SEO and accessibility, especially for the visually impaired.

## About tools ? 

Most of the SEO has been optimized using the lighthouse tool. 
The tool allowed to target problems such as:

* The image format (switch to webP)
* Script related issues (switch to defer)
* Performance issues related to the unminified file format

## Others best practices :

* Removal of all hidden divs/keywords (black hat)
* Meta tag optimization
* Addition of a description of about 70 characters using relevant keywords
* Removal of irrelevant information, which may in particular be considered as black hat.
* Simply add alt tag on img.
